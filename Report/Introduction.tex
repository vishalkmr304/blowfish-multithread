The aim of this project is to realize a program able to encrypt and decrypt a file using a multi-threaded implementation of the Blowfish algorithm.\\
The user must be able to specify with command line parameters:

\begin{itemize}
 \item If the program should encrypt or decrypt
 \item The input file name
 \item The cryptographic key
 \item The output file name
 \item The number of threads
 \end{itemize}  

The program have to be implemented in C programming language and must also print the total execution time for performance analysis purposes.
